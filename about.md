title: About this site
description: I'm currently learning different tools, among those, XML, XSL, R, LaTeX, knitr and Perl. I keep track from different projects and their documentation with this site. For my real work see our really awesome project site, which is going to be ready in some weeks. I think that the most interesting content will be directly on our project site, and here stuff that is experimental or not working very well.

### Acknowledgements
Niko Partanen works currently in a language documentation project in Freiburg. The project works with Ižma dialect of Komi language, and it has been funded by Kone Foundation. The project leaders are Rogier Blokland and Michael Rießler. This site may contain also materials Niko Partanen has done earlier or on his free time. Thereby the line of who has funded what becomes quite blurry. However, it must be said that without generous funding from Kone Foundation the majority of this work and learning behind it would had not been possible.
