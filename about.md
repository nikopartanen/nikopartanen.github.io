### Acknowledgements
Niko Partanen works currently in Izva Komi Documentation Project in Freiburg. The project has been funded by Kone Foundation. The project leaders are Rogier Blokland and Michael Rie√üler. This site contains also lots of materials Niko Partanen has done earlier or on his free time. Thereby the line of who has funded what becomes quite blurry. However, it can be generally said that without the funding from Kone Foundation the majority of this work and learning behind it would had not been possible.
