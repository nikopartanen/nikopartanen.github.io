Our project does need a website. All projects do have them. Though it is not always clear what do we need it for. We already had several discussions about this in our research group. Basically what we need is a site where can store description about our project and about our work, which can be updated easily but which would not necessarily be within traditional blog-framework.

## What's wrong with the alternatives

Not that much, to be honest! I have been using both Wordpress and Blogger before and liked them. However, there were several things that make them less than ideal.

- The need to sign in and use browser for writing
- The necessity of still writing or editing posts in HTML in order to make them look good
- Where is the original text? Many of good blogposts are something that could be reused while writing other things later, but do I have to go to the blog itself to get back my original text?
- Many things we write have at least a semi-scientific feel in them, so could there be a way to use citations from our bibliography while blogging?

But I think I have found a very good alternative for us.

## Github Pages & Jekyll

Our project is using GitHub to maintain version control between ELAN files. I learned a while ago that GitHub offers also free space for hosting a website. There are many ways to do that, but one of the more intriguing ones was to use tool called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It is a really cool program which I guess basically transforms text from one type to another - in this case languages like Markdown into HTML. I haven't really learned yet all of it, but the basic idea is that we can have our website template in GitHub and the actual side content is written in Markdown. Jekyll transforms Markdown into articles and blog-posts, and to add new content we just need to write something in an easy and simple text file, run Jekyll and to update our GitHub repository. And the site is running with new content. Immediately.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple text formatting syntax which can be easily converted to HTML or to other formats. Actually with [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) it can be even converted to PDF through LaTeX or then straight to .docx, among many other possibilities! This is very interesting and something to keep an eye on. Markdown is already used in many places, as an example in GitHub and StackOverFlow.

    ## This is how one makes a title
    
    Then this comes out as text **this is bold** and *this is italics*.
    
    - This would be a list item
    - And this is another
    
    This is again normal text

<br/>
Markdown has a very good ratio for amount of markup language and content. And it is possible to use references from BibTex as well, though I have not yet understood how it exactly works. Still, this makes it a very good tool for writing research reports and summaries. For research papers I suppose one still has to use LaTeX, but there is lots of everyday note taking which doesn't require that complicated environment.

## Site structure

The site works so that different content is set into different folders. In \_layouts folder there are possible layouts, and in YAML header in the beginning of the post one can specify which template is being used.

    .
    ├── _config.yml
    ├── _drafts
    |   ├── all_social_variation_in_Komi.md
    |   └── Niko's_ready_dissertation.md
    ├── _includes
    |   ├── footer.html
    |   └── header.html
    ├── _layouts
    |   ├── default.html
    |   └── post.html
    ├── _posts
    |   ├── 2014-08-01-post1.md
    |   └── 2014-08-02-post2.md
    ├── _data
    |   └── members.yml
    ├── _site
    └── index.html

<br/>
So basically command

    jekyll serve

<br/>
In the beginning of this structure converts the whole thing into HTML in the \_site folder. This can be used locally, and with command

    jekyll serve --drafts

<br/>
It even takes into account all draft files. Otherwise the posts in _drafts folder are ignored.
