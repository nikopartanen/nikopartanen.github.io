title: Transcriptions
description: "I need to create transliterations from transcriptions all the time. I think it doesn't really matter if my data is in Finno-Ugric transcription, IPA, cyrillic or in Научнӧй Коми Транскрипция. I think this is irrelevant in almost all cases. But all data has to be in one same system. How convert them to that, I kept asking. The answer was to learn some programming language, in this case Perl."

I must confess that I never really learned Perl. I've been learning it just to the point that it works for me. I understand that for more elaborate use I would need to actually understand what it does and why.

In Finno-Ugric linguistics there is every now and then discussion about which transliteration system one should use. Traditionally we have been using Finno-Ugric transcription system, but there are some problems with it, mainly the lack of full Unicode support for all characters. However, this is a rather small problem in the end, as 99% of characters we need, I would say, seem to be supported.

I guess the real problem here is that I don't believe the students of Finno-Ugristics learn anymore how to do a really exact and fine transcriptions. I just got my MA, and the amount of obligatory transcription exercises during my studies was so small that it would had not give very much background to handle real transcription tasks. I've been involved in different projects, mainly my own, in which I've ended up to transcribe larger amount of texts. I think I'm developing quite good ear to the variation in Komi dialects. However, I'm not doing either very phonetic analysis, and I'm not sure if anyone does anymore.

I've heard people arguing that as we have now original high quality recordings we don't need to do phonetic transcriptions for most of the uses we have. This certainly has some truth in it. There are many reasons why we should focus doing phoneme level transcriptions. Here are some of them.

- They are faster to do
- They can be easily compared to the written language as the level of exactness is more or less the same
- More exact sound values can always be checked from the recordings
- Phonetic transcriptions are necessarily relatively subjective as everyone may hear and interpret differently

However, the last point is valid also with phonemic transcriptions. Especially
